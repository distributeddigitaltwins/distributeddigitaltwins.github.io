Welcome to DiDiT 2026! The premier workshop on distributed digital twins, co-located with [the 22nd International Conference on Intelligent Environments](https://ie2026.pt/), June 15--18, Lisbon, Portugal.

## Scope

A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object, system, or process (including cities and even ecosystems) synchronized with the real-world entity it replicates.
It uses pervasive Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as sensors and actuators.
Through the application of digital technologies, such as AI, data analytics, and computer simulations, a DT application can be used to experiment, simulate, analyze, adapt, and optimize the behavior, performance, and maintenance of the real-world counterpart, including its interaction with other objects or systems.
However, intelligent environments often consist of complex, distributed, interconnected elements and sub-systems.
Real-time representation of the complexity of such interconnections poses many scientific and industrial challenges.

This workshop is a testament to the power of collaboration between academia and industry.
It provides a unique platform to explore the topic of distributed digital twins and to collectively identify and address the challenges of distributed ecosystems within large-scale cyber-physical systems.
By fostering innovation and progress in the field, this collaborative effort can lead to significant advancements.

The second edition of DiDiT will be organized in a hybrid format, enabling both on-site and remote participation.
It will feature a panel discussion with renowned experts from academia and industry, focusing on the overarching challenge of building sustainable Digital Twin ecosystems for intelligent environments.
In particular, the panel will explore how such ecosystems can remain viable and effective over time when involving multiple stakeholders, diverse objectives, and federated services at scale (e.g., city-level Digital Twins).

Key discussion themes will include:
* _The convergence of Digital Twins and AI_, examining how advanced AI techniques can enhance modeling, prediction, and autonomous decision-making within large-scale ecosystems.
* _Collaborative AI_, addressing how multiple intelligent agents and interconnected Digital Twins can coordinate effectively in shared environments.
* _From pilot to platform_, analyzing how experimental prototypes can be transformed into robust, operational systems deployed at scale.
* _Governance, federation, and long-term sustainability_, focusing on organizational, technical, and societal mechanisms needed to ensure the longevity of complex, multi-actor Digital Twin ecosystems serving large populations of users.
