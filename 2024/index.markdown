# DiDiT 2024 - 1st International Workshop on Distributed Digital Twins

Welcome to DiDiT 2024! The premier workshop on distributed digital twins, colocated at the [DisCoTec 2024](https://www.discotec.org/2024/) conferences June 17, Groningen, the Netherlands. 

## Scope
A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object, system, or process (including cities, and even ecosystems), synchronised with the real-world entity it replicates.
It does so by using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as sensors and actuators. Through the application of digital technologies, such as AI, data analytics and computer simulations, a DT application can be used to experiment, simulate, analyse, adapt, and optimise the behaviour, performance and maintenance of the real-world counterpart, including its interaction with other objects or systems. However, large industrial systems often consist of complex distributed and interconnected elements and sub-systems. Real-time representation of the complexity of such interconnections poses many scientific and industrial challenges.

This workshop provides a discussion platform for academia and industry to investigate the topic of distributed digital twins, shed light on the issues and challenges and propose solutions for the problems of distributed ecosystems in large-scale cyber-physical systems.

## Main Topics
We welcome papers with novel ideas in related topics, including (but not limited) to the following:
* Digital Twin architectures
* Theoretical models and foundations for distributed cyber-physical systems
* Distributed cyber-physical communication and coordination models
* Distributed digital twins properties, modelling and definitions
* Management and orchestration of distributed control systems
* Distributed decision-making with digital twins
* Adaptability and variability frameworks for distributed cyber-physical systems
* Testing and validation - approaches, frameworks, testbeds
* Verification of properties, models and definitions
* Real-world deployments and experimentations
* Interdisciplinary aspects of digital twins
