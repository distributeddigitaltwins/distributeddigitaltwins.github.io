Digital twins are reshaping the way systems are operating across various domains, seamlessly integrating the physical and digital realms, yet their full potential is often hindered by foundational challenges. This paper proposes a "Reliability-by-Design" approach, which is essential not just as a feature, but as a cornerstone in the life-cycle of digital twin applications. By embedding reliability from the outset, digital twins are considered more than just technological achievements as they become reliable assets that enhance operational effectiveness and unleash their true value to the organisation in question. We emphasize on the necessity of reliability for ensuring digital twins that are effective, efficient, and valuable. Through exploring the alignment of Reliability-by-Design with organizational objectives such as improved risk management, alignment with users and organisation's needs, and adaptability to changes, this paper highlights its role in supporting decision-making and achieving resilience while reducing costs. Emphasizing a value-driven approach, we advocate for the adoption of Reliability-by-Design to elevate the impact and sustainability of digital twin technologies across various sectors.
