subtitle: 2nd International Workshop on Distributed Digital Twins

Welcome to DiDiT 2025! The premier workshop on distributed digital twins, co-located with [the 21st International Conference on Intelligent Environments](https://www.ie2025.fraunhofer.de/), June 23--26, Darmstadt, Germany.

## Scope

A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object, system, or process (including cities and even ecosystems) synchronized with the real-world entity it replicates. 
It uses Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as sensors and actuators. 
Through the application of digital technologies, such as AI, data analytics, and computer simulations, a DT application can be used to experiment, simulate, analyze, adapt, and optimize the behavior, performance, and maintenance of the real-world counterpart, including its interaction with other objects or systems. 
However, intelligent environments often consist of complex, distributed, interconnected elements and sub-systems. 
Real-time representation of the complexity of such interconnections poses many scientific and industrial challenges.

This workshop is a testament to the power of collaboration between academia and industry. 
It provides a unique platform to explore the topic of distributed digital twins and to collectively identify and address the challenges of distributed ecosystems within large-scale cyber-physical systems. 
By fostering innovation and progress in the field, this collaborative effort can lead to significant advancements.

## Main Topics
We welcome papers with novel ideas in related topics, including (but not limited) to the following:
* Digital Twin architectures
* Theoretical models and foundations for distributed cyber-physical systems
* Distributed cyber-physical communication and coordination models
* Distributed digital twins properties, modelling and definitions
* Management and orchestration of distributed control systems
* Distributed decision-making with digital twins
* Adaptability and variability frameworks for distributed cyber-physical systems
* Testing and validation - approaches, frameworks, testbeds
* Verification of properties, models and definitions
* Real-world deployments and experimentations
* Interdisciplinary aspects of digital twins
